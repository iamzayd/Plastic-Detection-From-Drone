- Demonstrate and deploy a feasible solution with system architecture for implementation. 
Show tech stack, dashboards, and downstream actions which trigger a set of events for the 
detection and estimation of plastic.

- AI-based object detection and counting of plastic in images.

- The code should effectively detect plastic waste and provide its geolocation as a URL link.

- annotate weeds, and other debris.

- you may use state-of-the-art algorithms to build efficient solutions to detect and curb the plastic menace, which can help local authorities to take intelligent actions. Build a solution to identify 
the severity of the menace and develop an early intervention and warning system.

- The model's mean average precision, commonly referred to as mAP, needs to be a minimum of 65%.



PREDICT DATASET

i. IMG_ID: Image ID as given in the Predict Dataset
ii. PRED_LAB: Plastic Yes or No as per the image
iii. ACTUAL_CT: Actual count of the number of plastics in the given image 
iv. PRED_CT: Predicted count of the number of plastics in the given image (based on the number of plastic 
objects detected in the given image)
